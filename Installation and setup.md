# Getting setup to run PnET on Windows10

Currently, PnET is written in C++. At the very least, we need a `compiler` to convert *human-readable* source code into *computer-executable* machine code. For Windows, the compiler we'll be using is a version of [MinGW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinGW) called Mingw-w64.

Go to [SOURCEFORGE](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/), and click the download button.
